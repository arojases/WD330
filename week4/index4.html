        <h2>Accessing Form Elements</h2>
        <p> The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms
            in the document in the order they appear in the markup. Even though there is only one form in our example, a
            collection will still be returned, so we have to use index notation to return the first (and only) form
            object, like so:
            const form = document.forms[0];

            A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements
            contained in the form. In this case the form contains two controls: an input element and a button element:
            const [input,button] = form.elements;

            we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it's sent by adding a submit event listener.
        </p>
        <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
        <p> The concept of polymorphism means that different objects can have the same method, but implement it in
            different ways. The Object.prototype object has a toString() method that is shared by all objects. This
            means every object created in JavaScript will have a toString() method. Polymorphism means that objects are
            able to override this method with a more specific implementation. So although every object has a toString()
            method, the way it's implemented can vary between different objects. For example, calling it on an array
            object will return each value in a comma-separated string:
