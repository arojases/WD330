        The window object is the global object for client side JS. Node JS uses globals as an object.
      </li>
      <li>
        ES6 changed parseInt() and isNaN() from the Window object to the Number object.
      </li>

        Use window.location to get information about the current address. It is also possible to define the address
        where the user will be visiting.

        Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way
        of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol.

        The EU Cookie Directive is a piece of legislation that requires websites based in an EU country to ask for
        permission
        before setting any cookies. It's possible, however, that in the future this requirement may be part of a global
        browser
        setting, rather than the onus being on each individual website to ask for permission to set cookies.

        Using "this" in a setInterval or setTimeout would not work, other alternatives have to be used.

        In general, it is typically better to use CSS for any animation effects, although there
        may be times when JavaScript might be the better solution.

        The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom
        attributes that are ignored by the browser.

        The main HTML5 APIs all developers should know of are:
        <ul>
          <li>Webstorage (localStorage/SessionStorage)</li>
          <li>Geolocation</li>
          <li>Web Workers</li>
          <li>Websockets</li>
          <li>Notifications</li>
          <li>Multimedia (Video/Audio)</li>
