        <h3>Type coercion</h3>
        <p>Type coercion means that Javascript will read in an automatic way the data and will transform it to a "logic"
            value
        </p>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Arrays are a collection of values and they could be call by numbers as a list starting by 0 (being the first
            value of all list)</p>
        <h3>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
        <p>HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS:
            If a number starts with a 0x, it is considered to be in hexadecimal (base 16) notation:

            0xAF; // A represents 10, F represents 15
            175
        </p>
        <p>EXPONENTIAL NOTATION:
            Numbers can also be represented in exponential notation, which is shorthand for "multiply by 10 to the
            power of" (you may have heard this referred to as "scientific notation" or "standard form"). Here are
            some examples:

            1e6; // means 1 multiplied by 10 to the power 6 (a million)
            1000000

            2E3; // 2 multiplied by 10^3 (two thousand)
            2000
        </p>
