        <h3>nodeType property</h3>
        <p>
            For example, we can use the nodeType property to find out what type of node it is:
        </p>
        <p>
            body.nodeType; 1
        </p>
        <p>
            All nodes have a numerical code to signify what type they are. These are summmarized in the table below.
            Code Type
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 element
            </li>
            <li>
                2 attribute
            </li>
            <li>
                3 text
            </li>
            <li>
                8 comment
            </li>
            <li>
                9 body
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are other types not covered in the table, but these aren't used in HTML documents. As we can see from
            the table, a code of 1 confirms that body is an element node. We can also use the nodeName property to find
            the name of the element: body.nodeName; "BODY"
        </p>
        <p>
            Not Actually Arrays Node lists are array-like objects, but they are not arrays. You can access each item
            using index notation. For example, document.images[0] will return the first image in the node list of all
            the images in the document. They also have a length property, which can be used to iterate through every
            element using a for loop, like so:
            for (let i=0 ; i document.images.length ; i++) {
            // do something with each image using document.images[i] }
        </p>
        <p>
            Node lists don't have any other array methods such as slice, splice and join. ES6 makes it very easy to turn
            a node list into an array, however. You can either use the Array.from() method:
        </p>

        <p>const imageArray = Array.from(document.images);</p>

        <p>Or you can use the spread operator:</p>

        <p>const imageArray = [...document.images];</p>

        <p>Once the node list has been turned into an array, you can use all the array methods on it.

            some attribute names such as class and for are reserved keywords in JavaScript, so we need to use className
            and htmlFor instead.</p>
