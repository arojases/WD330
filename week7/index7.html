        <p>Async functions were added to the ES2017 specification. These functions are preceded by the async
            keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous. This is achieved by
            using the await operator before an asynchronous function. This will wrap the return value of the
            function in a promise that can then be assigned to a variable.
        </p>
        <h2>Promises</h2>
        <p> It also accepts two functions as arguments: the resolve() function is called if the operation is successful,
            and the reject() function is called if the operation fails:
        </p>

        <p>const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {</p>
        <p>// initialization code goes here</p>
        <p>if (success) {</p>
        <p>resolve(value);</p>
        <p>} else {</p>
        <p>reject(error);}});</p>
